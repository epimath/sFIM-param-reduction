Identifiability, active subspaces, and parameter reduction using the sensitivity FIM

Code for examining identifiability and active subspaces. This is the source code for:

The code given here will generate the figures used in the examples and case studies---these include a couple of basic, toy examples,
as well as two real-world applications:

- A cell cycle model taken from [1]

- Cholera transmission using the SIWR model (add cites)

Please cite the paper referenced above if you use our code or adapt it for your project.
